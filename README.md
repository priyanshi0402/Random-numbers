# Random-numbers

The Random Number Generator App is an iOS application that generates random numbers within a specified range. It provides users with a quick and convenient way to generate random numbers for various purposes, such as games, giveaways, or statistical simulations.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Range:** Users can define a custom range within which they want to generate random numbers. The app allows them to set the minimum and maximum values to ensure the generated numbers fall within their desired range.

- **Flexible Number of Digits:** The app supports generating random numbers with a specific number of digits. Users can specify the number of digits they want the generated numbers to have, providing them with greater control and flexibility.

- **Multiple Random Numbers:** Users can generate multiple random numbers at once. The app displays a list of randomly generated numbers, making it easy for users to obtain a set of random values with a single action.

## How It Works

1. Set Range: Users specify the minimum and maximum values for the desired range.

2. Set Number of Digits (optional): Users can specify the number of digits they want the generated numbers to have. If not specified, the app will generate numbers with a default number of digits.

3. Generate Random Numbers: Users click the "Generate" button to generate random numbers within the specified range and with the specified number of digits.

4. View Results: The app displays a list of randomly generated numbers, allowing users to view and use them as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **iOS Development:** The app is developed using Swift programming language and the Xcode IDE, leveraging the power of iOS frameworks and libraries.

- **Random Number Generation:** The app utilizes random number generation algorithms provided by the Swift standard library or external libraries to ensure truly random and unbiased results.
